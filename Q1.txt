Q1.Explain what the simple List component does.

The List component is a reusable React component that allows developers to create lists quickly and easily. It contains two components: SingleListItem and WrappedListComponent.

SingleListItem is a functional component that takes in four props: index, isSelected, onClickHandler, and text. It creates and returns a list item with a constant background color of red. When a user clicks on the item, the onClickHandler function is called with the index of the item as an argument. This function sets the setSelectedIndex state to the value of the index, which causes the isSelected prop to be true for the corresponding SingleListItem. This changes the background color of the selected item to green. SingleListItem is also wrapped in a memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

WrappedListComponent is a functional component that takes in an array of objects as props. It uses the map function to send the props to SingleListItem. It also has a function called handleClick that takes the index of the clicked item as input and sets the setSelectedIndex state to the value of the index. This allows the selected item to be highlighted. WrappedListComponent is also wrapped in a memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

Overall, List is a flexible and customizable component that allows developers to create lists with different text and styles. It simplifies the process of creating lists by providing reusable and efficient code.
