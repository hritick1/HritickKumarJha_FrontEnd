Q2.What problems / warnings are there with code?
There are 7 problems that I found out in the code they are as follows:

1. "items: PropTypes.array(PropTypes.shapeOf({
    text: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  })),"
-> This should be changed ,here the array should be changed to ArrayOf, shapeOf should be changed to shape

2. " {items.map((item, index) => ("
-> Here before writing a map to items we need to do a null check which can be done using items && items.map()

3."const [setSelectedIndex, selectedIndex] = useState();"
-> Here in this use state first value shoulde be the variable and next will be the function so we need to swap setSelectedIndex with selectedIndex.

4." isSelected={selectedIndex}"
-> It is taking selectedIndex as value which is of Number type but it requires boolean type. So I changed it and checked whether selectedIndex matches the index and returns true on match else false.

5."{items.map((item, index) => (
        <SingleListItem
          onClickHandler={() => handleClick(index)}
          text={item.text}
          index={index}
          isSelected={selectedIndex}
        />"
->When we are using map we need to give a key with a value so that every item in the list are uniquely identified by it.Here I am giving key as index .

6. " onClick={onClickHandler(index)}"
->Here we directly cannot pass the handler to the onclick but we need to create an arrow function and then pass it.

7."const WrappedListComponent = ({
  items,
}) => {"
-> Here it is better to add an empty array to items.

ALL these are the problems which I faced and then on resolving all I was able to run the component properly.
At the end I am providing the file with code which is free from any error.
